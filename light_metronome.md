## Light Metronome Privacy Policy
We don't gather or store any personal data, none whatsoever. I don't want it, and to be honest I don't know what I would do with it. This is just a simple freely distributed app, no catch.

This app is open source under the MIT license so feel free to have a poke around in the code on github.
